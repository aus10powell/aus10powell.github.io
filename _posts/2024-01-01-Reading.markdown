### Large-Language Models
* [Memory and MIPS (Max Inner Product Search)](https://chat.openai.com/share/46ff149e-a4c7-4dd7-a800-fc4a642ea389) Generally speaking, this deals with the concepts of having large corpus of documents that are represented in a high-dimensional space. After being given a new document, you want to find the document in your existing collection that is most similar to it. This is the maximum inner product search. The chat with GPT involves a discussion of this idea in relation to memory.

* [MealRec+: A Meal Recommendation Dataset with Meal-Course Affiliation for Personalization and Healthiness](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.05386): The task of meal recommendation involves intricate connections among users, courses, and meals, particularly through meal-course affiliation, yet existing datasets lack this crucial affiliation. To address this gap, the MealRec+ dataset is introduced, leveraging simulation methods to derive meal-course affiliation and user-meal interactions, and demonstrating that cooperative learning of these interactions improves the effectiveness of meal recommendations, with efforts also made to enhance the healthiness of recommendations.

## Vision
* [YoloV10: Real-Time End-to-End Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14458) Among other improvements in efficiency, the highlight may be tackeling the speed issues caused by NMS.
* [Faiss: A library for efficient similarity search](https://engineering.fb.com/2017/03/29/data-infrastructure/faiss-a-library-for-efficient-similarity-search/):  Facebook AI Similarity Search (Faiss), a library that allows us to quickly search for multimedia documents that are similar to each other
