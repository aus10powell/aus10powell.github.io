Living in SF East Bay. Iâ€™m passioned about technology, statistics and all data science subjects. I've taken 2 years of Latin and particularly enjoy  NLP-related areas of data science. I do enjoy a good hike or long run. One of my big bucket list items is to make it through the Abbott World Marathon Majors. If you're also looking to get that qualifying time for Boston Marathon, I've done a quick analysis of which races you might want to target given you're living in SF Bay Area [here](https://github.com/aus10powell/projects/blob/master/mini_project_notebooks/fastest_marathon.ipynb) (spoiler: the famed California Marathon may not be your best bet).

For a great read on marathoning (and excellent data analysis), I highly recommend the Medium posts by Barry Smith. From personal experience, I've found all the information about pacing to  be spot on.
